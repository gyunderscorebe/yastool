# Yet another screenshot tool

This mod adds an item called `Screenshot area selection tool`. When used as an empty blueprint to select a rectangular area, it takes a high resolution screenshot of that area, using maximum possible resolution given a limit on resolution and a limit on number of pixels per tile. Additionally, it automatically snaps the area to the tile grid so that the screenshot includes only whole tiles. Screenshots are saved to the `script-output` directory within the [application directory](https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory), using unique file names including current tick number. All the limits and options can be configured in the mod settings, with two sets of configuration: normal and alternative (used if holding `Shift` while taking screenshots).
